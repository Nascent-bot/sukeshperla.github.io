Your life is sum of your experiences.

If I were in 1985 I would not have missed the first Windows launch. If I were mature in 2007, I would not have missed the iPhone launch also. But now I realise, I can even be a part of such a revolutionary event. The art of predicting future outcomes based on historical data and trends is a topic that has always fascinated me. Data Science is in use everywhere now, whether itâ€™s for predicting buyer preferences on online shopping sites or for influencing political victories. The vast scope of data science and analytics for practical application in all areas of industry and technology has made it my dream choice for further studies as well as the ideal career option after my Bachelors in Computer Science Engineering.

And so my journey to pursue masters began with burning desire to learn the fascinating AI, Machine learning and Data Science. My plan to pursue masters opened up various opportunities and options as the world is quite big. My choices ranged across continents from United States, Canada, Ireland, UK to Australia, and New Zealand. Yeah, Quite large number of options. After careful analysis on different countries and opportunities. I made a decision to pursue my masters in the Emerald Isle. There are large number of reasons behind this decision starting from Ireland being the only english speaking country in Europe, Having some of the reputed universities in the world(UCD ranks top 100 in world ranking), Affordable tuition fee, Vast opportunities, importantly warm & friendly people, and Guinness!

I moved to Dublin on August, 2021 and kicked off my masters in September. It was quite fascinating to experience the different part of the earth, especially if you are travelling for first time out of your  country. Surreal experience to witness all 4 seasons starting from subtle winds to extreme blowing away ones during winter.

My masters was one of the best moments in my life be it pursuing my dream course, adapting to new ways of learning, experiencing huge campus of 40,000 students, meeting new friends from across the world, starting a part time job, struggling with assignments, learning not to mess up cooking, questioning my choices and finding a job I love, Wow it was hell of a ride!

Now if I look back, all I could think of is "How much I would have missed in my life, if I have not boarded that one flight back in 2021". When I sit back and think how far I have come, it's quite interesting and assuring, Surely there is more to go. At last I truly believe If I can make it, anyone can make it. Let's overcome the limitation of the mind and break the odds.
